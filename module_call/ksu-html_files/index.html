                    <h2>Recipe 3: Veggie Momos</h2>

                    <p>
                        1.Finely cut all vegetables as mentioned in the ingredients section.
                        2.Add 3/4 cup maida (all purpose flour), 1 teaspoon oil and salt in a large bowl.
                        3.Mix all ingredients well and prepare a soft pliable dough (like paratha dough) by adding water as needed. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 20-25 minutes.
                        4.Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan over medium flame. Add finely chopped ginger and garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Add green onion and sauté for a minute.
                        5.Add all chopped veggies (carrot, cabbage, capsicum and green beans) and salt.
                        6.Mix well and sauté them for 4-5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon chilli sauce.
                        7.Add 1/2 -1 teaspoon soy sauce.
                        8.Add 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder.
                        9.Mix well and sauté for a minute. Turn off the flame. Stuffing for Veg Momos is ready.
                        10.Knead the dough again for a minute and divide it into 2-equal portions. Give each portion a round cylindrical shape like cucumber. Cut each one into 6-7 equal portions with a knife as shown in the photo.
                        11.Give each small portion a round shape like ball and flatten it a little into pattie by pressing it in between your palms. Cover them with a wet cloth or a plate to prevent them from drying.
                        12.Place one dough pattie on a rolling board and roll it out into a thin disc (approx. 4-5 inch diameter). Roll it from sides and keep the center portion little thick compared to sides. If required, sprinkle some dry flour while rolling.
                        13.Place approx. 1 tablespoon filling in the center. Do not over-stuff it, otherwise it will be difficult to get a proper “potli” shape.
                        14.Lift the edge from one side and start pleating (fold the edge a little inside and then little outside alternatively). Join them in the center to seal it.
                        15.Prepare momos from remaining dough patties in a similar way.
                        16.Grease a steamer plate or any other plate (it should easily fit into the steamer or a deep vessel) with oil to prevent them sticking. You can also line a plate with cabbage leaf instead of greasing the surface with oil. Arrange Veg Momos on a plate in a way that there is some space around them to expand.
                        17.Heat 1-2 glass of water in a steamer or a deep vessel over medium flame.
                        18.Place stand in the steamer and place momos plate over it. Momos should not touch the water. Cover the steamer/vessel with a lid and steam them for 6-7 minutes over medium flame or until they look little translucent and shiny. Remove the lid and check them by touching it. If they do not feel sticky then it means they are cooked.
                        19.Transfer them to a serving plate. Serve hot Veg Momos with Momos Chutney or Schezwan Sauce.

                    <h2>Recipe 2: Carrot Cake Macarons</h2>
                    <img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OSK.0b135b0df3e6c2b964ae1fa1796a31c1&w=228&h=342&rs=2&qlt=80&o=6&cdv=1&dpr=1.3&pid=16.1" alt="bing.com">
                    <p>
                        1.Sift almond flour and powdered sugar three times. Yes, three. Not only are we combining the two ingredients, we are also aerating the dry ingredients to get that beautiful full interior.Unless your almond flour is chunky, I don’t recommend processing the dry ingredients in the food processor, because you may over-process the almond flour, which would lead to blotchy shells from oily almond flour.
                        2.Whisk the egg whites in a large mixing bowl until foamy. Then add cream of tartar and salt, and continue beating. Once the mixture is white, start adding sugar, one tablespoon at a time, making sure the sugar is mostly dissolved before adding more.
                        Whisk the meringue until stiff peaks form.   
                        TIP 1: Room temperature egg whites whip better and get more volume, but cold eggs separate better. So separate the egg whites right out of the fridge, and allow the egg whites come to room temperature on the counter for about 30 minutes.
                        TIP 2: Make sure the mixing bowl and whisk are completely grease-free and egg whites have no yolks in it. Any trace of fat may ruin your meringue and it will not allow your meringue reach hard peaks. Glass, stainless steel or copper bowls are the best!
                        TIP 3: Use super-fine granulated sugar, or caster sugar for meringue, as it dissolves easily.
                        TIP 4: Do not rush it! Beat the meringue on low and consistent speed for the most stable meringue. I continuously whisk the egg whites on speed 2 or 4 on my KitchenAid mixer the entire time. It does take a little longer this way (12-14 minutes!), but I think it is totally worth it!
                        3.Add almond flour mixture into the meringue and gently fold until incorporated, using a rubber spatula. Then fold the batter until lava-like consistency, which means the batter is thick, yet runny enough to slowly flow off the spatula in a continuous flow to draw a figure eight.
                        TIP:One way to test the consistency of the batter is to drop the batter into a ribbon and count to 10. If the edges of the ribbon are dissolved back into the batter in 10 seconds, the batter is ready!
                        4.Transfer the batter into a piping bag, fitted with a round tip (I use Wilton 2A tip). And pipe 1.5-inch rounds on two baking sheets, lined with parchment paper. Now tap the baking sheet on the counter for 3 times to pop any air bubbles trapped in the shells. If needed, use a toothpick to pop stubborn bubbles.
                        5.Rest the shells before baking until skin forms. This could take anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours. It all depends on humidity. If you are in humid climate, you may use a fan to expedite the drying process. Bake the shells in a preheated oven at 300°F for 15-18 minutes. I do nOt use convection settings for baking macarons. My oven is set to heat from top and bottom.
                        6.Fill the macarons with any kind of filling. The most common fillings are ganache, buttercream, jams and curds.
                        Once you have filled the macarons, place them in an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or preferably for 24 hours. This process is called maturing, which allows the filling to soften and flavor the shells.
