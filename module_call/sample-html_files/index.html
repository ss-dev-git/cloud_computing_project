<p>The objective of this project is to demo how you can leverage IaaS in AWS using Terraform to build a VPC (virtual cloud platform, and spin off websites for a client when/if needed).
</p>

<p>"Terraform is a tool for infrastructure provisioning to build out infrastructure through code, often called Infrastructure as Code. So, terraform allows you to automate and manage your infrastructure, your platform, and the services that run on that platform. It's open source and declarative, which means you define what you want (the desired "end state") rather than describing precisely each step or how to do it.

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn what Terraform exactly is, terraforms use cases or what it's used for, Terraforms Architecture, and the basic commands. In addition, the [video clarifies] the difference between Terraform and Ansible because they seem to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, [the video] explains what the terms and concepts of "infrastructure provisioning,‚Äù "infrastructure as code," or "declarative vs. imperative" mean.

In the tutorial, you get an excellent overview of what Terraform is, how Terraform works, and how it does its job to get started quickly."</p>
